# BigNumber
A high-performance Big Number library for Godot games. Perfect for idle / incremental games, or any project where you need numbers exceeding the limits of standard integer and float types.

This plugin was built upon ChronoDk's [GodotBigNumberClass](https://github.com/ChronoDK/GodotBigNumberClass), credits to him!
Though my version uses GDExtension instead, for optimization.

Check the comparison below (results may vary):

Hardware used for testing:
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600
- AMD RX 6750XT
- 48 GB RAM 3200MHz
- 512 GB SSD M.2

## Why Use BigNumber?
Managing massive numbers in games is performance-heavy and complex. This plugin provides you with:
- Capable of handling numbers much larger than float or int
- High Performance
- Built-in support for multiple notation styles:
    - Scientific (1.23e45)
    - AA Notation (aa, ab, ac...)
    - Metric Symbols (k, M, B, T...)
    - Metric Names (kilo, mega, giga...)
- Methods similar to standard arithmetic operations.

This is a GDExtension plugin, built with performance in mind.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release
2. Extract to your Godot project, and make sure this is how your project structure looks:
```
your_project_folder/
├── addons/
